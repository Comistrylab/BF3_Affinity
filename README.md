# BF3_Affinity
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for predicting experimental Lewis Base Affinity and Lewis Polybase Binding Atoms in the complex formation with Boron Trifluoride (BF3).

This study aims to resolve two critical tasks in the realm of Lewis acid-base interactions that have not been quantitatively investigated. First, machine learning developed from simulation is successful at predicting the experimental properties of Lewis adducts. Second, the models can identify the binding atoms of Lewis polybases in 1:1 adducts, which is either improbable to obtain with experiments, or computationally expensive for quantum simulation.
